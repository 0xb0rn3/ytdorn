cd ytdorn

# Make the script executable (Linux/macOS)

```

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Launch YtDorn without arguments to enter the guided experience:

```bash
python ytdorn.py
```

You'll be walked through an intuitive process:

1. **Content Selection**: Choose what type of content to download
2. **URL Input**: Paste your YouTube link
3. **Preview**: See basic information about your content
4. **Directory Setup**: Select where to save your downloads
5. **Format Choice**: Pick your preferred quality and format
6. **Extra Options**: Configure subtitles, thumbnails, and more
7. **Confirmation**: Review settings and start downloading

### Command-Line Interface

For power users and automation, YtDorn offers comprehensive CLI options:

#### Basic Downloads

```bash
# Download with best quality to default location
python ytdorn.py -u "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Specify quality and output directory
python ytdorn.py -u "VIDEO_URL" -f 720p -o "/path/to/videos"
```

#### Audio Extraction

```bash
# Extract high-quality audio
python ytdorn.py -u "VIDEO_URL" --extract-audio

# Convert to MP3 with specific bitrate
python ytdorn.py -u "VIDEO_URL" --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
```

#### Batch Operations

```bash
# Process multiple URLs from a file
python ytdorn.py --batch urls.txt

# Use a preset for consistent settings
python ytdorn.py --batch urls.txt --preset high_quality_mp4
```

#### Information and Management

```bash
# Get detailed video information
python ytdorn.py --info "VIDEO_URL"

# List all available presets
python ytdorn.py --list-presets

# View all available options
python ytdorn.py --help
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

YtDorn uses a JSON configuration file located at `~/.ytdorn_config.json` to store your preferences and presets. This file automatically tracks your recent output directories and custom download configurations.

### Creating Presets

Presets allow you to save common download configurations for quick reuse. You can create them through the interactive interface or by directly editing the configuration file.

Example preset structure:
```json
{
  "presets": {
    "high_quality_mp4": {
      "format": "1080p",
      "output_dir": "/home/user/Videos/YouTube",
      "subtitles": true,
      "thumbnails": true
    }
  }
}
```

## üìã Download Options

### Content Types
- **Single Videos**: Download individual YouTube videos
- **Playlists**: Complete playlists or specific items within them
- **Channels**: All videos from a YouTube channel
- **Custom Selections**: Flexible content targeting

### Quality Options
- **Video**: Best available, 1080p, 720p, 480p (MP4 preferred)
- **Audio**: Best quality audio formats (M4A, Opus) or MP3 conversion
- **Custom**: Advanced users can specify any valid yt-dlp format string

### Additional Content
- **Subtitles**: Download and optionally embed subtitle files

- **Metadata**: Description files and comprehensive JSON metadata

## üîß Dependencies

Understanding YtDorn's dependencies helps ensure smooth operation:

### Core Dependencies
- **yt-dlp**: The download engine that handles YouTube's complex formats and restrictions. YtDorn automatically checks for this and attempts installation via pip if missing.

### Optional but Recommended
- **FFmpeg**: Essential for audio conversion (especially MP3), format transcoding, and subtitle embedding. While not strictly required for basic video downloads, many advanced features depend on it.

If FFmpeg is missing, YtDorn will display a helpful warning and guide you to installation resources. You can typically install it through your system's package manager:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg
```
